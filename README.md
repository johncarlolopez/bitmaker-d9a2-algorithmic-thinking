# 02 - Algorithmic Thinking with Scratch
### Thursday, Dec 14th

Your task is to recreate [this](https://natalieblack.github.io/scratch-demo/) game. You can choose to either start a new Scratch project or build on the one you just made.

Part of the challenge of this assignment is to explore what's possible with Scratch. You'll have to experiment with scripts that we didn't cover in the warm-up tutorial (a "script" being one of those little coloured blocks of code), so donâ€™t be afraid to try out new things to see what they do.

If you're feeling confident, feel free to proceed without relying on this guide. Otherwise, keep reading for some guidance about how to approach this problem.

Your first task should be to make it possible to move the sprite using the four arrow keys: the up arrow should increase the sprite's y coordinate, the down arrow should decrease its y coordinate, the right arrow should increase its x coordinate and the left arrow should decrease its x coordinate.

Next make the sprite "bounce" when it touches the edge of the screen (as in the warm-up tutorial).

Add a second sprite through the "new sprite" menu near the bottom of the page.

Each sprite is coded separately. You can toggle back and forth between your two sets of code by clicking on the images of the sprites in the "sprites" panel at the bottom of the page.

Make the second sprite appear in a random location when the program starts.

Make the second sprite bounce if it touches the edge of the screen.

When the first sprite touches the second sprite, the second sprite should jump to a new random location. Hint: check out the options in the "sensing" menu to check if the two sprites are touching.

You did it!
